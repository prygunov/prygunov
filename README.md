## 👋 Hi there, I'm Maksim!

I'm a Java/Kotlin backend developer passionate about clean architecture, distributed systems, and performance-driven code. I love solving complex problems and building systems that scale 🚀

I'm the creator of:

- 🎮 [Stalker PDA](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.artux.pda&hl=ru&pli=1) – an immersive S.T.A.L.K.E.R.-inspired Android app. A little love letter to the Zone.

- 🌐 [artux.net](artux.net) – my personal playground for experiments and ideas.

💼 Currently, I work as a backend developer at one of the leading Russian big tech companies — T-Bank, where we build high-load fintech services with care and precision.
